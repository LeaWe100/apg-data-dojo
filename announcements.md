## Data Dojo 2023

Announcements and session outlines

### Introduction

Dear everyone dealing with data,

We are excited to announce a new training format, the *Data Dojo*!

Unlike the *Coding Bootcamp*, the dojo format focuses on individual sessions and follows an open door policy where you choose the sessions that are most relevant to you. If you want to, you are of course welcome to join all sessions.


We plan to work on the following topics:
* Data handling and abstraction
* Time series analysis
* Automated Testing


We introduce each topic with a very brief summary of important concepts and you then work in pairs/teams on different sets of problems that are most relevant to you. Additional sessions are solely dedicated to the sharing, review and discussion of your progress and to work on the examples. The workshops will be very exercise-driven and the work in the plenum centers on the exercises that you decide to work on. You can share your code with me throughout the entire workshop series so I can support your development process.


Above topics span a wide range of methods and tools that we can by no means cover in-depth nor do we intend to do so. Instead we aim to create a space where you can develop your individual skills and share your progress and learnings with a group of like-minded colleagues.


If that sounds interesting to you, save the dates below!


We decided to introduce this format to cater to your different needs and schedules. Since it is the first iteration, we are curious to receive your feedback and are very much looking forward to working with you!


If you have any questions to ask or issues to raise, don’t hesitate to reach out.


Cheers,
Claus

### Topics

#### Data handling and abstraction

How can we handle/organize (save, load, …) data? Why does it matter? What about databases and REST APIs? What is an abstraction?

#### Time series analysis

Aspects such as: Exploration, correlations, trends, quality checks, visualization,  …

#### Testing

What is a test? Why is testing relevant? How can a test support my development? How can I implement a test for my own code?

### Schedule

See your calendar.
