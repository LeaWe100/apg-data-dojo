# Compare Data Storage Options

In our data science workflows, at some point, we usually want to
[persist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)) data.

While we may not have control over how our initial raw or input data is
stored, this changes once we hold it in our hands and it is useful
to be able to navigate the plethora of options available.

## Learning goals

* Understand different options to store data.
* Be able to make an informed decision about how to store your data.
  * Know about usage scenarios and properties of different approaches
    and their advantages as well as disadvantages depending on the context.

## Session Outline

### Warmup

In your team, discuss:
* In which form is the raw input data in your projects?
* What kind of data formats are you familiar with?
* What kind of data formats do you use in your projects?
  * Who made the decision and on what grounds?

Agree on the following:
* Criteria that can be useful to differentiate/categorize different approaches.
* Properties that are useful to describe different approaches.

### Do

Tasks:
- [ ] Compile a list of storage options.
- [ ] Compile a list of criteria and properties that are relevant to you.
- [ ] For each storage option,
- [ ] Collect questions you may have that you want to discuss with your peers.

The outcome of your discussion could take different forms:
* A table that provides a handy overview.
* A tree that provides decision support.
* A guideline that gives a definite recommendation.

### Reflect

* How did you come up with a comprehensive list of storage options?
  * Did you learn about a new one?
* How did you learn about the properties or pros and cons of the different choices?
* How did you compare file-based and database-based options?
  * How are they different?
  * How are they similar?
* How and why is the choice of the storage option relevant in your project?
* To which extend does the choice of the storage option affect the
  implementation details of your project?
