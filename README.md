### Facilitation

Individual guidance and collaborative sharing are an essential
part of this format.

How can we achieve that?
1. Create a GitHub account and send me your handle.
1. Publish your work in a separate branch and create a merge request
   * Others can access your work
   * I can provide feedback

If that does not work for some reason (in order of preference):
1. Share your work through an issue (either text or upload)
1. Share your work through a shared document, using for example
   https://pads.c3w.at/code/ or similar
1. Send me your work by mail for download link

## Bring your own topic

You want to discuss a topic that is not yet listed?

Go ahead and make a suggestion!

In doing so, try to be as specific as possible:
* What is the problem you try to solve?
* What do you already know?
* Why is your current approach not feasible?
* What input to you need to solve your problem?

Create and issue or write me an email.
